        Do:
          Always use proper punctuation and grammar.
          Introduce your app clearly and succinctly.
          Describe your app's most notable features. 
          Use conversational language.
          Think about your target customer and highlight features that will appeal to that customer.
          Explain how and why your app will benefit users.
          Show off—don't forget to include the attributes that make your app stand out and feel free to do so in detail.
        
        Don't:
          Refer to your app only as "this app" or "an app"—use your app's full name at least once in your product description
          Make false, hyperbolic claims—this type of marketing rarely works and may hurt your app in the long run
          Just write one single sentence—there's more to your app
          Simply list your app's features, explain why these features are awesome and worth adding to a customer’s app collection
          Exercise atypical or inappropriate language that could mislead or confuse customers
          Use excess punctuation that could distract from the information you are conveying.
